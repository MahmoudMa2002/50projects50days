# Theme Clock - Analog Clock with Dark Mode Toggle

A real-time analog clock with smooth needle animations and a dark/light theme toggle functionality.

## What I Learned

- **Date Object Manipulation** - Working with JavaScript Date object to extract hours, minutes, seconds, and date information
- **Mathematical Scaling** - Converting time values to degrees for clock needle rotation using linear interpolation
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Using CSS variables for dynamic theme switching and consistent color management
- **Transform Operations** - Applying CSS transforms for needle positioning and rotation with proper transform origins
- **Real-time Updates** - Implementing setInterval for continuous clock updates and smooth second-by-second animations
- **Event Delegation** - Handling click events for theme toggle with proper DOM class manipulation

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced UI** Added circular border around clock and hover effect to toggle button for improved user experience.
