# Vertical Slider - Gaming-Themed Split-Screen Slider

A visually striking vertical slider featuring split-screen design with logos and backgrounds, showcasing smooth vertical transitions and responsive interaction controls.

## What I Learned

- **DOM Element Manipulation** - Using querySelector to select and manipulate multiple slide elements dynamically
- **Transform Animations** - Implementing translateY transforms for smooth vertical sliding effects between content
- **Event Handling** - Managing click events on navigation buttons to control slide direction and state
- **CSS Positioning** - Working with absolute positioning and z-index to layer slider components effectively
- **Viewport Calculations** - Using clientHeight and viewport units (vh/vw) for responsive full-screen layouts
- **Array-like Operations** - Calculating slide indices and implementing circular navigation logic

## Key Improvements Made

- **Theme Integration** - Transformed generic nature content into a showcase featuring Metal Gear Solid V, MGS3, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Nier Automata
- **Enhanced Visual Assets** - Replaced placeholder content with logos and layered backgrounds
- **Improved Logo Presentation** - Added proper image sizing, drop shadows, and positioning for professional logo display
- **Gradient Background Design** - Implemented custom gradient backgrounds that complement each game's color palette
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - The site is not fully mobile-friendly, but I added basic media queries with logo rotation and adaptive sizing for slight improvements on smaller screens.
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Added keyboard controls for improved accessibility and user experience

## Features

- Split-screen vertical slider with independent left and right panel animations
- Circular navigation that loops seamlessly between slides in both directions
- Smooth CSS transitions with 0.5s ease-in-out timing for professional feel
- Intuitive controls using arrow buttons positioned at the slider intersection point or the keyboard arrow keys

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser and use the up/down arrow buttons to navigate between slides. The left panel displays game logos with gradient backgrounds while the right panel shows corresponding atmospheric game backgrounds that transition vertically in opposite directions.
