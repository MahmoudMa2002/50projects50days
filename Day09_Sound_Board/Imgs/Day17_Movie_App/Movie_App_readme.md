# Film Finder - Movie Discovery Application

A dynamic movie discovery app that allows users to browse popular films and search for specific titles using The Movie Database API with pagination and interactive movie details.

## What I Learned

- **API Integration** - Fetching data from external APIs using async/await and handling JSON responses
- **Dynamic DOM Creation** - Creating HTML elements dynamically with createElement() and innerHTML
- **Pagination Logic** - Implementing next/previous functionality with proper button state management
- **Event Handling** - Managing form submissions, search functionality, and click events
- **CSS Hover Effects** - Creating smooth transform animations and overlay transitions
- **URL Encoding** - Using encodeURIComponent() for safe API query parameters

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Applied modern dark theme with sticky header, smooth card animations, logo and default backgrounds for films with no posters
- **Interactive Elements** - Added hover effects with the movie external link integration
- **Pagination Logic** - Implementing next/previous functionality with proper button state management and page tracking
- **Responsive Design** - Implemented flexible grid layouts with proper image handling and loading states
