## Info
**Tech:** HTML, CSS (Keyframe Animations, Pseudo-elements, Filters)  
**Focus:** CSS animations, transform properties, pseudo-element manipulation  


## Features
- Dual rotating triangular elements with independent animation cycles
- Smooth ease-in-out transitions for natural kinetic motion
- Glowing effects with CSS drop-shadow filters
- Atmospheric breathing background effect with radial gradient overlay
- Pulsing loading text animation


## Improvements Made
- **Enhanced color scheme** – Implemented CSS custom properties with a dark theme using primary, secondary, accent, and glow color variables
- **Advanced visual effects** – Added drop-shadow filters to create glowing effects on the rotating triangles
- **Atmospheric background** – Created animated radial gradient overlay that breathes and scales to add depth
- **Improved typography** – Added loading text with spacing, weight, and pulsing animation
- **Modern gradient background** – Replaced solid background with a linear gradient


## What I Learned
- CSS pseudo-elements for creating complex shapes and animations
- Border manipulation using transparent borders to create triangular shapes
- Complex keyframe animations with multi-stage rotation and precise timing
- Transform combinations for layered animation effects
- CSS filters for adding visual depth with drop-shadow and glow effects
