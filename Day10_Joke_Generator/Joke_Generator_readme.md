# Dad Jokes Generator - API-Powered Humor App

A dynamic joke generator that fetches random dad jokes from an external API and displays them with smooth loading animations.

## What I Learned

- **API Integration** - Working with REST APIs and handling JSON responses
- **Error Handling** - Using try/catch blocks for robust error management
- **Loading States** - Creating user feedback during asynchronous operations

## Key Improvements Made
