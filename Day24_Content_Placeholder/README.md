## Info
**Tech:** HTML, CSS (Custom Properties, Keyframe Animations), JavaScript, APIs  
**Focus:** Skeleton loading patterns, API integration, Promise.all(), gradient animations  


## Features
- Realistic skeleton loading animation with shimmer effects
- Dynamic content loading from JSONPlaceholder and RandomUser APIs
- Smooth transition from placeholder to actual content
- Text truncation to maintain consistent card layout
- Interactive button to generate new random content
- Responsive card design with hover animations


## Improvements Made
- **Dynamic API integration** – Added real API functionality using JSONPlaceholder and RandomUser APIs to populate cards with actual data
- **Enhanced visual design** – Added hover effects with transform animations and improved box shadows
- **Better typography** – Improved font weights, sizes, and spacing for improved readability
- **Improved card layout** – Enhanced structure with better padding, spacing, and content organization
- **Better styling** – Added subtle transitions, rounded corners, and improved button design
- **Better animation timing** – Added shimmer animation duration and easing for more natural loading effects


## What I Learned
- CSS skeleton loading patterns that mimic final content structure
- Gradient animations with keyframe animations for shimmer effects
- Promise.all() method for handling multiple simultaneous API calls
- API integration with JSONPlaceholder and RandomUser APIs
- Text truncation functions for consistent layout
- Dynamic class manipulation for state transitions
