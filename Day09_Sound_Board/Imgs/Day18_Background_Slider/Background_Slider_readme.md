# Background Slider - Immersive Image Carousel Component

A dynamic background slider that displays full-screen images with smooth transitions and synchronized background changes.

## What I Learned

- **Background Image Manipulation** - Changing body background images using JavaScript style properties
- **Array Index Management** - Implementing circular navigation with proper boundary checking and wraparound logic
- **CSS Opacity Transitions** - Creating smooth fade effects between slides using opacity and CSS transitions
- **Event Listeners** - Handling click events on navigation buttons with proper function calls
- **CSS Positioning** - Using fixed and absolute positioning for overlay elements and slide management
- **CSS Pseudo-elements** - Creating background overlays with ::before pseudo-elements for better content visibility

## Key Improvements Made

- Not many improvements were made, as it's a fairly simple project

## Features

- Full-screen background image display with smooth transition effects
- Left and right navigation arrows for manual slide control
- Circular navigation that loops from last slide back to first
- Synchronized background and foreground slide changes
- Semi-transparent overlay for better content visibility and focus
- Smooth opacity transitions between slides for seamless viewing

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser and use the left and right arrow buttons to navigate through the background image slideshow.
