# Hydration Tracker - Interactive Water Intake Monitor

A visual water consumption tracker that helps users monitor their daily hydration goals with an interactive cup interface.

## What I Learned

- **Dynamic Height Manipulation** - Adjusting element heights programmatically to create visual fill effects
- **CSS Visibility Control** - Using visibility and height properties to show/hide elements smoothly
- **Event Delegation** - Adding click listeners to multiple elements using forEach and index parameters
- **Conditional Logic** - Implementing complex if/else statements for interactive state management
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Using CSS variables for consistent color theming across components
- **Unit Conversion** - Converting between milliliters and liters for accurate measurement display

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Applied modern dark theme with custom CSS variables and smooth transitions
- **Interactive Elements** - Added hover effects on small cups with scaling animations

## Features

- Click-to-fill functionality for individual 250ml water cups
- Dynamic progress visualization with animated height changes in main cup
- Real-time calculation of remaining water intake and percentage completed
- Visual feedback with color changes when cups are filled
- Reset button to clear all progress and start over
- Smooth transitions and hover effects for better user experience
- Unit conversion between liters and milliliters for small remaining amounts

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser, click on the small cups to track your water intake, and watch the main cup fill up as you progress toward your 2-liter daily goal.
