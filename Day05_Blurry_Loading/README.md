## Info
**Tech:** HTML, CSS (Filters, Positioning), JavaScript  
**Focus:** Dynamic effects, mathematical scaling  


## Features
- Dynamic blur effect that reduces from 30px to 0px as loading progresses
- Simultaneous text opacity fade from 100% to 0%
- Real-time percentage counter from 0% to 100%
- Mathematical scaling function for smooth value transitions
- Automatic interval cleanup when loading completes


## Improvements Made
- **Progress bar** – Added visual progress bar alongside the countdown


## What I Learned
- CSS filter properties for dynamic blur effects
- Mathematical scaling functions for value mapping
- Opacity manipulation for fade effects
- CSS absolute positioning for full-screen coverage
- Performance optimization with interval cleanup
