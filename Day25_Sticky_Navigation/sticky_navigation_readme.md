# Sticky Navigation - Responsive Navigation Bar with Scroll Effects

A dynamic navigation bar that transforms when scrolling, featuring smooth transitions and responsive design with themed content about Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away.

## What I Learned

- **Dynamic Class Manipulation** - Adding and removing CSS classes based on scroll position for state changes
- **Fixed Positioning** - Implementing sticky navigation with proper z-index layering and positioning
- **CSS Transitions** - Creating smooth animations between navigation states using transition properties
- **Responsive Navigation** - Building navigation that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Element Offset Properties** - Using offsetHeight to calculate precise scroll trigger points

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Implemented gradient backgrounds, hero sections with overlay effects, and improved typography using "Spirited Away" inspired fonts
- **Advanced Layout Structure** - Added content sections with proper spacing, and visual hierarchy for better readability
- **Professional Styling** - Enhanced the navigation with gradient backgrounds, smooth scaling effects for the logo, and refined color schemes
- **Improved Responsiveness** - Added comprehensive media queries and flexible layouts for better mobile experience
