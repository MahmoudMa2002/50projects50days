# Hidden Search - Expandable Interface

A simple expandable search interface that transforms from a simple button into a full search input with smooth animations.

## What I Learned

- **CSS Transitions** - Creating smooth width and transform animations for UI elements
- **Dynamic Styling** - Using JavaScript to toggle CSS classes for state management
- **CSS Positioning** - Working with absolute positioning for layered button placement
- **Placeholder Management** - Controlling placeholder visibility based on component state
- **Transform Properties** - Using translateX for precise element positioning
- **Event Handling** - Managing click events for interactive state changes

## Key Improvements Made

- Not many improvements were made, as it's a fairly simple project

## Features

- Expandable search input that grows from 50px to 200px width
- Smooth button translation that follows the expanding input

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser and click the search button to expand the input field. Click again to collapse it back to the button state.
