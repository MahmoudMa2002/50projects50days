# Scroll Animation - Image Gallery

A dynamic scroll-triggered animation system that reveals images from alternating sides as users scroll through the page.

## What I Learned

- **Scroll Event Handling** - Implementing window scroll listeners for dynamic interactions
- **getBoundingClientRect API** - Using viewport position detection for element visibility
- **CSS Transform Properties** - Creating slide-in animations with translateX values
- **Pseudo-selectors** - Using nth-of-type for alternating animation directions
- **Viewport Calculations** - Setting trigger points based on window height ratios

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Applied dark theme with custom color scheme fitting for Blader Runner 2049
- **Dynamic Content** - Integrated high-quality images instead of placeholder content
- **Contextual Theming** - Added logo and cohesive visual identity
- **Improved Styling** - Enhanced responsive design with mobile-optimized layouts
- **Improved UX** - Added a button to take the user back to the top of the page

## Features

- Scroll-triggered animations that activate when elements enter viewport
- Alternating slide directions (left/right) for visual variety
- Automatic show/hide functionality based on scroll position
- Responsive design with mobile-optimized spacing and sizing
- Smooth CSS transitions with custom timing and easing

## Usage
