# Good, Cheap, Fast - Interactive Project Triangle

An interactive demonstration of the classic project management triangle where users can select any two of three options (Good, Cheap, Fast) with automatic constraint enforcement and smooth toggle animations.

## What I Learned

- **Event Handling Optimization** - Implementing forEach loops with addEventListener for multiple element management
- **State Management** - Tracking multiple checkbox states and implementing automatic deselection logic
- **CSS Custom Animations** - Creating smooth toggle transitions with cubic-bezier timing functions for natural movement

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Implemented a dark theme with custom CSS variables and professional color palette
- **Improved Toggle Animation** - Added smooth cubic-bezier transitions with bounce effects
- **User Experience Improvement** - Added descriptive subtitle text to explain the constraint rule clearly

## Features

- Interactive toggle switches that demonstrate the project management triangle principle
- Automatic constraint enforcement that prevents all three options from being selected simultaneously
- Smooth toggle animations with cubic-bezier easing for natural movement and visual appeal

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser to interact with the project triangle. Click any two toggles to see them activate, then try to click the third - watch as the system automatically deselects one of the previous choices to maintain the "pick any two" rule. The interface clearly demonstrates why you can't have all three qualities in a project.
