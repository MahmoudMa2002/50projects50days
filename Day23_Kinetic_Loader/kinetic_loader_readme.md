# Kinetic Loader - Animated CSS Loading Spinner

A loading animation featuring rotating triangular elements with smooth kinetic motion and effects.

## What I Learned

- **CSS Pseudo-elements** - Creating complex shapes and animations using ::before and ::after pseudo-elements
- **Border Manipulation** - Using transparent borders to create triangular shapes from rectangular elements
- **Complex Keyframe Animations** - Implementing multi-stage rotation animations with precise timing and easing
- **Transform Combinations** - Combining multiple transform properties for layered animation effects
- **CSS Filters** - Adding visual depth with drop-shadow filters and glow effects
- **Animation Timing** - Coordinating multiple animations with different delays and durations for synchronized motion

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Color Scheme** - Implemented CSS custom properties with a dark theme using primary, secondary, accent, and glow color variables
- **Advanced Visual Effects** - Added drop-shadow filters to create glowing effects on the rotating triangles for more visual impact
- **Atmospheric Background** - Created an animated radial gradient overlay that breathes and scales to add depth
- **Improved Typography** - Added loading text with spacing, weight, and pulsing animation for a better appearance
- **Modern Gradient Background** - Replaced solid background with a linear gradient for more visual interest

## Features

- Dual rotating triangular elements with independent animation cycles
- Smooth ease-in-out transitions for natural kinetic motion
- Glowing effects with CSS drop-shadow filters
- Atmospheric breathing background effect with radial gradient overlay
