# Drag & Drop Interface

A simple, interactive drag and drop component built with JavaScript.

## What I Learned

- **HTML5 Drag & Drop API** - Working with dragstart, dragend, dragover, dragenter, dragleave, and drop events
- **DOM manipulation** - Moving elements between containers dynamically
- **CSS transitions** - Creating smooth visual feedback for user interactions

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Visual Feedback** - Added smooth transitions, hover effects, and better color scheme
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - Optimized sizing and layout for smaller screens
- **Code Quality** - Cleaner event listener setup

## Features

- Drag and drop image between containers
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Mobile-responsive design
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser and drag the image between the containers.
