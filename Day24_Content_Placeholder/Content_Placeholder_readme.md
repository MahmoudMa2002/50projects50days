# Content Placeholder - Loading State Animation

A skeleton loading screen with animated placeholder elements that transitions to real content from external APIs.

## What I Learned

- **CSS Skeleton Loading** - Creating realistic placeholder layouts that mimic final content structure
- **Gradient Animations** - Using linear gradients with keyframe animations to create shimmer effects
- **Promise.all() Method** - Making multiple simultaneous API calls and handling their responses together
- **API Integration** - Working with JSONPlaceholder and RandomUser APIs for dynamic content generation
- **Text Truncation** - Implementing text limiting functions to ensure consistent layout and readability
- **Dynamic Class Manipulation** - Adding and removing CSS classes to transition between loading and loaded states

## Key Improvements Made

- **Dynamic API Integration** - Added real API functionality using JSONPlaceholder and RandomUser APIs to populate the card with actual data instead of static placeholder content
- **Modern Dark Theme** - Implemented a color scheme with CSS custom properties including primary, secondary, tertiary, light, and text color variables
- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Added hover effects with transform animations and improved box shadows for better interactivity
- **Better Typography** - Refined font weights, sizes, and spacing for improved readability and visual hierarchy
- **Improved Card Layout** - Enhanced card structure with better padding, spacing, and content organization
- **Professional Styling** - Added subtle transitions, rounded corners, and improved button design for a polished appearance
- **Better Animation Timing** - Optimized shimmer animation duration and easing for more natural loading effects

## Features

- Realistic skeleton loading animation with shimmer effects
- Dynamic content loading from JSONPlaceholder and RandomUser APIs
- Smooth transition from placeholder to actual content
- Text truncation to maintain consistent card layout
- Interactive button to generate new random content
- Responsive card design with hover animations

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser to see the loading animation, then watch as real content from APIs replaces the placeholders. Click "Get Another Card" to load new random content.
