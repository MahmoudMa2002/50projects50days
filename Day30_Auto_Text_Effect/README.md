## Info
**Tech:** HTML, CSS (Custom Properties), JavaScript  
**Focus:** String manipulation, setTimeout management, real-time input handling  


## Features
- Continuous typewriter animation that cycles through text infinitely
- Real-time speed adjustment from 1 (slowest) to 5 (fastest) without interruption
- Smooth character-by-character text revelation with consistent timing
- Dark theme design with custom CSS variables
- Responsive control panel positioned at the bottom
- Input validation with visual feedback for invalid speed values


## Improvements Made
- **Better input validation** – Improved form styling with focus states and invalid input visual feedback
- **Polished styling** – Refined overall design with shadows, borders, and modern themes


## What I Learned
- String manipulation using slice() method to progressively reveal characters
- setTimeout management with recursive calls and clearTimeout for dynamic timing
- Real-time input handling to update animation speed without interruption
- Mathematical speed calculations converting user values to millisecond intervals
- Event-driven programming for responding to user input during animations
- Continuous animation loops with index reset for seamless text cycling
