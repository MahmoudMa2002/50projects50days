# Button Ripple Effect - Interactive Button Animation

Interactive buttons with Material Design-inspired ripple effects that animate from the exact click position.

## What I Learned

- **Mouse Event Coordinates** - Working with clientX and clientY properties to capture precise click positions
- **Element Positioning** - Using offsetTop and offsetLeft to calculate relative positions within elements
- **Dynamic Element Creation** - Creating and manipulating DOM elements programmatically with JavaScript
- **CSS Animations** - Implementing keyframe animations with transform scaling and opacity transitions
- **Event Loop Management** - Using setTimeout to clean up dynamically created elements after animations complete
- **CSS Overflow Handling** - Managing element overflow to contain ripple effects within button boundaries

## Key Improvements Made

- Not many improvements were made, as it's a fairly simple project

## Features

- Multiple interactive buttons with individual ripple effects
- Ripple animation originates from exact mouse click position
- Smooth scaling animation with fade-out effect using CSS keyframes
- Automatic cleanup of animation elements after completion
- Hover effects with subtle scaling and color transitions

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser and click any of the buttons to see the ripple effect animate from your cursor position.
