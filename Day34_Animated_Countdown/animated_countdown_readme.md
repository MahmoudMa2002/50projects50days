# Animated Countdown - Dynamic Sequence Animation

A countdown timer with smooth rotation animations and event-driven sequencing, featuring automatic progression through numbers with a finale presentation and replay functionality.

## What I Learned

- **Animation Event Handling** - Using animationend events to trigger sequential animations and state transitions
- **CSS Transform Combinations** - Implementing transforms with translate, rotate, and scale for dynamic visual effects
- **Sequential Animation Logic** - Creating cascading animations that automatically progress through multiple elements
- **Event-Driven Programming** - Managing animation sequences based on completion events rather than fixed timing
- **DOM State Management** - Dynamically adding and removing CSS classes to control element visibility and animation states
- **CSS Keyframe Mastery** - Designing keyframe animations with rotation, scaling, and easing transitions

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Implemented a dark theme with custom CSS variables and gradient text effects
- **Professional Typography** - Enhanced text styling with gradient backgrounds, proper font weights, and letter spacing
- **Better Button Design** - Styled replay button with hover effects, transitions, and uppercase text treatment

## Features

- Smooth countdown animation sequence from 3 to 0 with automatic progression based on animation completion
- Dynamic rotation animations with natural bounce effects using keyframe transitions
- Event-driven animation system that responds to animationend events for precise timing control
- A finale presentation with scaling animation and gradient text effects for visual impact
- Replay functionality with complete DOM reset and animation restart capability

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser to watch the animated countdown. The sequence will automatically progress from 3 to 0 with smooth rotation animations, then display the final "GO" message with a dramatic scaling effect. Click the replay button to restart the entire animation sequence from the beginning.
