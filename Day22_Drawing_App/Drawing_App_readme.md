# Drawing App - HTML5 Canvas Drawing Tool

An interactive web-based drawing application with adjustable brush sizes, color selection, and drawing capabilities.

## What I Learned

- **HTML5 Canvas API** - Working with canvas context for 2D drawing operations and path manipulation
- **Mouse Event Handling** - Capturing mouse movements, clicks, and position coordinates for drawing interaction
- **Canvas Drawing Methods** - Using beginPath, arc, moveTo, lineTo, stroke, and fill methods
- **Dynamic Styling** - Changing stroke width, fill colors, and line styles programmatically
- **Event Coordinate Systems** - Understanding offsetX and offsetY for accurate cursor position tracking
- **Canvas State Management** - Managing drawing state with boolean flags and coordinate tracking

## Key Improvements Made

- **Responsive Canvas Design** - Added dynamic canvas resizing that adapts to window size while maintaining aspect ratio and usability
- **Enhanced UI Design** - Implemented a modern toolbox, improved spacing, and styling
- **Interactive Button Effects** - Added hover animations with translateY transforms and box shadows for better user feedback
- **Improved Layout Structure** - Enhanced toolbox layout with flexbox, proper gap spacing, and responsive design considerations
- **Better Visual Hierarchy** - Added distinct styling for different tool types including size display, color picker, and clear button
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - Added media queries for better mobile experience with flexible canvas sizing
