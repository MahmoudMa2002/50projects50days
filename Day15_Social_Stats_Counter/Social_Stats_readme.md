# Social Stats Counter - Animated Number Counter Component

A dynamic social media dashboard that displays animated counters for different platforms with smooth incrementing animations and modern card-based design.

## What I Learned

- **Recursive Functions** - Using setTimeout with recursive calls to create smooth counting animations
- **Data Attributes** - Storing target values in HTML data attributes and accessing them with getAttribute()
- **Math.ceil()** - Rounding up decimal increments to create realistic counting effects
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Using CSS variables for consistent theming and color management
- **FontAwesome Icons** - Integrating brand icons for social media platforms
- **Flexbox Layouts** - Creating responsive grid layouts with flex-wrap and gap properties

## Key Improvements Made

- **Enhanced Visual Design** - Applied modern dark theme with custom CSS variables and card shadows
- **Interactive Elements** - Added hover effects with smooth transform animations
- **Responsive Design** - Implemented mobile-optimized layouts that stack vertically on smaller screens

## Features

- Animated counter increment from 0 to target values with realistic timing
- Individual social media platform branding with authentic brand colors
- Smooth hover animations with card lift effects
- Dark theme design with modern typography using Roboto Mono font
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Custom increment speed calculation based on target values

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser and watch as the counters automatically animate from 0 to their target values for each social media platform.
