# Animated Navigation - Interactive Mobile Menu Component

A sleek animated navigation component that transforms from a compact hamburger menu into a full navigation bar with smooth CSS transitions and rotating animations.

## What I Learned

- **CSS Transitions** - Implementing smooth width and transform animations with linear timing functions
- **Transform Properties** - Using rotateY() and rotate() for 3D rotation effects and hamburger icon animations
- **Toggle Functionality** - Using classList.toggle() to manage active states dynamically
- **CSS Flexbox** - Creating responsive layouts with flexible alignment and justification
- **Overflow Control** - Managing content visibility during animations with overflow-x: hidden

## Key Improvements Made

- Not many improvements were made, as it's a fairly simple project

## Features

- Click-to-expand/collapse functionality with animated width transitions
- Smooth hamburger icon transformation into an X when menu is active
- 360deg rotation effects for navigation menu items with opacity fade-in

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser and click on the hamburger menu icon to expand or collapse the navigation menu.
